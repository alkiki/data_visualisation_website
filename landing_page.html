        This project focuses on data visualisation that connects various
        diseases to the genes associated with them. This network shows that many
        diseases have common genetic causes. When genes are linked to similar
        diseases, their products (like proteins) tend to interact more, and
        their activity patterns are more alike. This suggests that there are
        specific groups of genes and their products that work together in ways
        that are unique to each disease.

          This website consists of three graphs. First one is a more genereic
          perspective on how all of the cancer-related diseases and genes are
          associated with each other. Each node in the graph represents either a
          disease or a gene, while the edges denote the connections between
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second graphs represents diseases that have the most gene related
          to them as a pie chart. Each slice of the pie represents a disease,
          and the size of the slice corresponds to the number of genes
          associated with that particular disease. It has an interactive
          feature, by clicking on each part of the pie chart the user can find
          out more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third and final graph shows information about the genes and which
          has the most connections to different diseases.
